1. Setting Up the Variables

This program analyzes hurricane data. Identifies and filters and retrieves the severe storms, and displays relevant information back. In this section I initilized the variables that will be used in the program.


2. Retrieving the Data

In this section I ensure the data file is sucessfully opened. Then loop through the contents in the storm, filtering only category 3+ storms while updating the current information.


3. Displaying the Data

Finally the data is put together by contructing a table with titles, and column headings.
